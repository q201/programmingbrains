            <h1>What is Machine Learning? </h1><br>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical 
                models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data, 
                identifying patterns, making decisions, and improving their performance over time.</p>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;margin-bottom: 50px;">Types of Machine Learning</h1>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; "><a href="" >Supervised Learning: </a></h3>
 
<span></span>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is for the model to 
learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict the output for new, unseen data.  
The model is trained on labeled data. It learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.
<br><i>Examples:</i> Regression, Classification.

<h3 style="margin: 50px 0 20px 0; "><a href="">Unsupervised Learning:</a></h3>
<span></span>
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data without explicit labels. The goal is to
 find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Unlike supervised learning, there is no provided output to 
 guide the learning process. 
The model is trained on unlabeled data. It tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
<br><i>Examples:</i> Clustering, Association.

<h3 style="margin: 50px 0 20px 0; "><a href="">Semi-Supervised Learning:</a></h3>
<span></span>Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning.
 It uses both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy. Typically, a small amount of labeled data is 
 combined with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
 
 <h3 style="margin: 50px 0 20px 0; "><a href="">Reinforcement Learning(RL):</a></h3>
 <span></span>Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an 
 environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled input-output pairs but 
 instead learns from the consequences of its actions.
 <br>
 <i>Examples:</i> Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN).
